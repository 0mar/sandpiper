# Contents of presentation

1. Introduction / Project aim
What will we do, context, application
2. Introducing homogenization theory
Rapid variation, power expansion, upscaled solution
3. Model
Poisson equation with rapid varying coefficients
4. Finite element approximation / Fenics implementation
Weak form (basis functions used)
5. Solution and corresponding approximation in 1D
Exact, numerical (h / eps relation, convergence rates), upscaled solution.
6. Approximation and upscaling in higher dimensions
Convergence rates, nice paraview images, maybe a movie
7. Solvers, preconditioners
Show computation times (hopefully motivate) *check Fenics docs, some num-lin-alg book*
8. Make a nice example of some 3D timevarying simulation.
